1. The 4 communication building blocks:
  1.1 People: Who will be there? What do I need to know about them?
  1.2 Message: Is email appropriate, or should I pop in for a quick chat?
  1.3 Context: How's the timing of this email?
  1.4 Listening: What kind of listener do I want to be right now? 


1.1 People: Thinking about the other person's perspective is important.
            Considering people: think->feel->do.
            Mental filters: levels of knowledge, personal concerns, or preconceived notions. Those filters decode how we receive or/and understand a message.

1.2 Message: Non-verbal signal, tone of voice. Chanel that is used to send a message. 
             Considering messages: do you think your message is meant to inform? Does your message aim to persuade?
            Check your message for understanding.

1.3 Context: Time and location and relationship.

1.4 Listening: Listen with your ears, eyes, and heart.
               use reaffirming nonverbals.
              connect (empathetic listening).
